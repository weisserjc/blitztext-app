# Blitztext App

> 📱 **Fork status:** this fork contains the original experimental macOS menubar app
> plus an iPhone/iPad-oriented iOS app with a custom Blitztext keyboard. See
> [README-iOS.md](README-iOS.md).

Blitztext App is an experimental open-source Swift app for turning speech into text.

It is intentionally small and unfinished. The goal is to make a real workflow visible and hackable: press a hotkey, speak, get text back, optionally rewrite it, and paste it into the app you were using.

This is a learning and experimentation project, not a polished product.

> Preview status: bring your own OpenAI API key, no hosted backend, no warranty, no support guarantee.

## What It Does

### macOS

- **Blitztext**: record speech and transcribe it.
- **Blitztext+**: record speech, transcribe it, then turn the rough draft into cleaner writing.
- **Blitztext $%&!**: turn frustrated speech into a calmer message.
- **Blitztext :)**: add fitting emojis to dictated text.

### iOS

- **Blitztext keyboard**: start dictation from any text field through a custom keyboard.
- **Blitztext iOS app**: records with the microphone, transcribes with OpenAI Whisper, and hands the result back to the keyboard.
- **Two modes**: use literal transcription or an improved mode that cleans up and shortens the text while preserving meaning.
- **No clipboard read**: the iOS keyboard receives prepared text through the shared keychain to avoid recurring iOS paste prompts.

## Important Preview Notes

- macOS and experimental iOS targets are included.
- Bring your own OpenAI API key.
- No hosted Blitztext backend is included or provided.
- In online mode, audio and text are sent directly from the app to the OpenAI API.
- Optional local transcription via WhisperKit/CoreML if you install a compatible model locally.
- `./build.sh` creates a locally ad-hoc-signed development app. No notarized release binary is provided.
- Not production ready.
- No warranty and no support guarantee.

You are welcome to use, fork, adapt, and share this project under the license terms.

The intent is not to ship a one-click finished app. The intent is to make a real AI workflow understandable: clone it, build it, read the code, change it, break it, fix it, and suggest improvements. If you only want to download something and never look inside, this preview will probably feel rough. If you want to learn how a small native macOS AI app is put together, you are in the right place.

## Requirements

### macOS

- macOS 14 or newer
- Xcode 16 or newer (Swift 5.10), with Command Line Tools installed and selected for `xcodebuild`
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to generate the Xcode project
- For online transcription and rewriting: an OpenAI API key with access to:
  - `whisper-1` for transcription
  - `gpt-4o-mini` and optionally `gpt-4o` for rewriting
- For local-only transcription: a WhisperKit CoreML model in:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Blitztext/models/whisperkit/`

The build also pulls one Swift Package dependency automatically:

- [`argmax-oss-swift`](https://github.com/argmaxinc/argmax-oss-swift) (WhisperKit) — used for local on-device transcription.

### iOS

- A real iPhone or iPad for device testing.
- Xcode with a development team configured for local signing.
- Full Access enabled for the Blitztext keyboard in iOS Settings.
- An OpenAI API key for transcription and rewriting.

Install XcodeGen if needed:

```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

## Build And Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weisserjc/blitztext-app.git
cd blitztext-app
./build.sh --run
```

For a local install into `/Applications`:

```bash
./build.sh --install --run
```

The generated `.app` is ad-hoc signed for local development only. Do not treat it as a trusted redistributable binary. A public binary release would need Developer ID signing and notarization.

On first launch, either paste your own OpenAI API key for online workflows or install a WhisperKit CoreML model for local transcription. Rewriting workflows still require OpenAI.

For fully local transcription, install a WhisperKit CoreML model and enable **Sicherer Lokaler Modus** in the app.

For a slower, more explicit walkthrough, see [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

For iOS build and install notes, see [README-iOS.md](README-iOS.md) and
[docs/ios-keyboard-mvp.md](docs/ios-keyboard-mvp.md).

## Permissions

Blitztext asks for:

- **Microphone**: to record your voice.
- **Accessibility**: to paste the result back into the app you were using.

If you do not grant Accessibility permission, you can still copy results manually.

## Data Flow

The preview has no custom backend.

```text
Online transcription: Your Mac -> OpenAI Audio Transcriptions API
Text rewriting:       Your Mac -> OpenAI Chat Completions API
Local transcription:  Your Mac -> WhisperKit/CoreML on device
```

The app stores your OpenAI API key in the user's macOS Keychain.

Read [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) before using the preview with sensitive content.

## Local Models

Local transcription is available as an experimental WhisperKit/CoreML path. The app does not bundle a model; choose one in the app, click install, and then switch on **Sicherer Lokaler Modus** from the menu bar or settings.

See [docs/local-models.md](docs/local-models.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially if they make the preview easier to build, understand, or fork.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
